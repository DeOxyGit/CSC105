                    <hr> The tyrannical demon king "the misfit" shows the trajectory he will endeavor in this new era.

                    The one that has appeared in front of Anos, who prevented the war between demons and humans, was a
                    new
                    "child of the god" who has come to annihilate the tyrannical demon king. The misfit who overcomes
                    all
                    odds heads on to a new battle.

                    "After being reincarnated into a peaceful era, I've learned how to hold back a bit."
